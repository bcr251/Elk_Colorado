## Map Title: Elk Populations in Colorado (2018)

This map visualizes changes in big game populations in the state of Colorado in correlation to wildfires, urban areas, and floods in 2018. "ElkResidentPopulationArea is an ESRI SDE Feature Class depicting resident population areas for elk in Colorado. This dataset represents Elk Resident Population Areas which are defined as an area used year-round by a population of elk" (Biologists, C. P. and W). The data on elk distributions in Colorado was collected from field personnel. In the early 1900s, elk populations in North America had decreased to only 40,000 due to the unregulated hunting market. The Colorado Park and Wildlife staff and conservationist, through relocation efforts, have brought the population back to life. The elk population in Colorado now exceeds 280,000 and is among the largest in the world (Colorado Parks and Wildlife). My map demonstrates how past flooding, wildfires, and deforestation/development may have affected the elk population, and hopes to uncover some possible  patterns in their residential areas in the state of Colorado. The map also visualized where Elk populations tend to reside: throughout the mountains or other ecological niches by incorporating Google terrain. The map was created using QGIS.
