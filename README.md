## Map Title: Changing Elk Populations in Montana (2012-2022)

This map visualizes changes in big game populations in the state of Montana over the last 10 years. “According to Montana’s current elk management plan, the statewide elk population goal is about 92,000 animals. In 2020, FWP estimated the population to be nearly twice that at 170,000” 9 (Kantner 2022). As populations grow, elk management has reached “crisis levels” (Northern Ag Network 2021).
My map demonstrates how past flooding and wildfires have affected the elk population for the past 10 years, and hopes to uncover some possible reasons for the population explosion in Montana. The map was created using QGIS.
